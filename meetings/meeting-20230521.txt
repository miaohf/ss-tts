Yeah, hi, everyone. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me on this particular session. My name is Canal. I've been with straight street around more than 5 years now, and within Straight street. I have been part of the client services. So I started my journey with Jimmy Morgan as my first company, and I stayed there with her with more than 12 years. I did mostly the custody, credit, risk fx transactions, and you know all the custody that type of related work, accounting and everything. So i'm just going to quickly, you know.
Pull down the client services overview, so i'll just share my screen right now. Just let me know if you are not able to you, I don't know today Internet is like It's troubling me a lot. So no worries. So this is what we are all about what we do is basically we interact with the client. Our client is basically segregated into 3 zones. which is your asset managers, your asset owners and the insurance. So your asset managers are basically the clients who are actually managing the asset for the other institutions.
Right? Your asset, almost your client base, which is actually managing. You know their self asset, and we are providing the custodial services for them. And then you have the insurance, you know, insurance client, which is actually an insurance player in the market.
So these this is basically our You can say the classification of clients in terms of how we provide service to them. Primarily there are 2 types of services that goes out of the bank. When is your custody's custody service? And there is your accounting. So one is your custody only clients, and then you have your full service clients which we gave the custody plus accounting services as well
So in our core trying, you know, if you, if you look at this particular circle right, this is our full circle What we do is we provide inquiry, management. When I say inquiry management. It is basically interacting with with the client on with, with the help of a tool called Inquiry Management tool. It's a way based portal where you know, or any interaction that comes on that particular tool. It actually generates a ticket, and what we do is our representatives. Look at that particular ticket, partner with multiple teams, and then go back.
Go back to the you know, to the client, or if they are any internal teams who wants to, you know, look for any transaction from the client. Then our team comes into picture, and then we kind of help had them through. The other. Is your your specialized operation. When we say specialized operations, there are a lot of clients who actually wants more than inquiry management services, and they want customized reports
They they want to understand their cash.
chat
Based on the provided transcript, it appears that Canal is a member of the client services team within Straight Street and interacts with clients in three zones - asset managers, asset owners, and insurance providers. The team provides custodial and accounting services to clients, with some receiving both services as full-service clients. The team uses an inquiry management tool to interact with clients and generate tickets for representatives to partner with multiple teams. They also offer specialized operations such as customized reports and assistance with understanding cash.

miaohf
You know positions in the market how it is so that they can make the investment, and that is primarily mostly on the asset manager services. You know where where we kind of do a real time reconciliation of their cash and provide them with feeds right? And then what they do is they take on this particular feed they reconcile against within their system, and then, you know, they invest in the market. So that that is your inquiry management, your specialized operations. We also do cash exceptions. So the cast exceptions is basically external between State Street and the clients. So right now we handle around more than 3,000 plus clients and investment managers right? And what we do is that we we. if there is any break in the cache right? So, for example. if the client has sent a wire to Straight Street right and Straight Street is not able to apply that particular funds into the account, then what will happen is that there will be a break which will generate in a C Lp. System. So we have a system called Tp right? And what we do is that we will extract the report out of TIp, and then reconcile and make the you know that exceptions go away so, and then we have client reporting, sO like every day we we receive millions and billions of transactions in Straight Street. What we do. Who is?
There are a lot of reports which client wants, and they would like to understand it if there are fail injections. And you know there are a lot of regulatory reports that client want like fast P. Which. or you know fast, is something or the tax report. You know their financial statements and everything. We kind of provided health. That lines with all those kind of reports.
So this is our core activity. This is what we generally do. We also do side by side project management. You know what we W. What I say in terms of project management is. We look at
optimization to how to reduce our inquiries, which is coming out from the client. How we can provide the, you know. Advertise my State Street because it's a it's a self help too, and we want all our clients to probably adapt to my street street.
and then we also do fax elimination, where, if the client is sending faxes to get processed in the bank, then we probably reach out to the client and say that we have this tier application which can probably help you automate, you know, and you don't need to send in facts to the bank.
so that will increase our step-through rate right, and there will be less exceptions, and there'll be less work for the clients. And so we also cut across with multiple teams within the bank, and we also do some value added services like we do cash projections, we do fails, which I'm talking about the green circle. Now we also do like lot of transformation. You know we do fund set up. So if there is a new client which comes. We set up their funds right. When I say fund, that is their account number. We set up their my straight street. Id right we have. We have weekly monthly calls with our client, tried to understand the sentiments, and how they are going, and how you know how they feel that we are kind of working right? So this is a small example of. We have 2 clients in the asset manager segment, which is, and primarily a bigger client, which is fidelity and gam right and Fidelity, once upon a time was rankings fixed out of 6 custodial, but the client services team they partnered with lot of other teams. Right. They partner with the joint ventures group. They got the entire State Street into one teams channel right, and we provided coverage to our client, and then slowly, by slowly, we started turning around the sentiments, and then now fidelity is ranking us a first out of 6 custodians. So so sorry. So first is basically. Your number one custodian out of all the 6 historians in the market. So with that, with that we also got a lot of revenue into the bank.

Based on the continued transcript, Canal explains that Straight Street provides real-time reconciliation of clients' cash in order for them to make investments. The team handles more than 3,000 clients and investment managers, and offers services such as inquiry management, specialized operations, and cash exceptions. They also provide reports for clients, including regulatory reports and financial statements. In addition, they do side by side project management to optimize their inquiries and reduce fax usage. Value-added services such as cash projections and fund setup are also offered. Canal gives an example of how the team partnered with multiple teams to turn around the sentiments of a larger client, Fidelity, resulting in them ranking Straight Street as their first choice out of six custodians in the market and bringing revenue into the bank.

miaohf
Right so. And and the purpose, I'm saying is, these are the things which actually makes the client happy when we kind of create an exceptional service for our client when we understand the client sentiment, and then we start delivering on that, and we tell client that what we are doing for them.
That is an important communication that needs to go out. So in this the client services team, the service delivery India team, the relationship managers right? They all come into one, you know one place, and then we device strategies and we device path to green.
I know some of you guys must be working on Rfps as well. Right we we. We come into play there. We'll be part of that particular Rfp. We understand. What does client require, and then we start delivering all those particular operational things which kind of helps. And and then what you're selling to the client is something we're executing on the floor.
so that so that you know, when we kind of execute it perfectly. The client understands the sentiment. and then they and they said, that will. I want to stay, or I want to give more business to Straight Street, you know. So things like that.
So probably I'll take a pause here if there are any questions i'm happy to answer. all right, sure.
So probably if 1°11 move to the next slide, so you can see this is how we were set up in India. So we we had around transition of 140, those members in Bangalore and Hijaba, you know, and we did earlier called the
Client
Delivery Management, right? We had this Uss which is your United States investor services team. We had this asset manager services, the Lux team, the Canada reportings, and we were managing this key client, Fidelity G.
Sam capital, and they were all trending amber and red. So in 2,019 and 2,020 we started building the structure right. We got the accounting and custody segregated right. We started, see positive sentiments and improvement in the client set satisfaction right. Fidelity and Gstan. They started as ranking Number 2 because we started doing Facebook services for them. Then we had we had asset to not a segment with 109 over 169 headcount added to the service delivery footprint. and then we started. We did the transition of the insurance service delivery client with 23 headcount.
which is added to the India footprint. and then in 2,02123, you started scaling the team. So we had more induction, which is like your Cayman team we had in Japan plan services coming into us. We had the Canada and the new traditions were completed.
we became, we created the cast exceptions, a ring fence team right now, which kind of achieved the target. The the banks target right forecast exceptions, we reviated all the hotspot. When I say hotspot is. When we did this transition there were a lot of issues with the team, right, we and with with the clients. So we kind of reviewed each and every issues, and then we started remediating them, and then we became a stabilized team.
We centralized all the North America, Ems. And Lex under one umbrella and asset on the render one umbrella right? So which kind of cricket and provide it as an opportunity to functionalize. And then we we did some transformation opportunities, and the Id set up. So when I say I do set up. It is actually a my straight street application set up.
So we kind of closed the automation of phase one. So this is probably our journey at a very high level, right?
And then this is my option. So currently I I manage around 490 members team right, and I have the Luts team, which Is managed by a Vp. The we then I have guide 3. She's, a Vp. Who is managing the Ams in Canada.
I have Buffal, who is managing the insurance and the Uss. And then he's also managing it's getting across asset to us, and then I have a he! He's managing the Canada and us. He's just joined you when he's from military background. So i'm hired in Diversity candidate, you know. So we kind of
that as well, so that in a nutshell is probably the entire, you know, at a very high level, and then a very quick summary of the client services team. Could I, By the way, this was this was absolutely a perfect 15 min.
Yes. So any client where the your both team kind of comes into picture. The boating is actually in our processing team, but the client services will actually interact with the client and get the relevant forms. and you know the client will express their intent to open new funds and client services will help them, you know, to get the new funds through a particular form which is called You just call the new fund setup form.
